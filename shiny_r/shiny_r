## Challenges
# The first challenge I encountered occured when I was filtering the dataset. I had written "obesity" instead of OBESITY and this resulted in the counties not appearing in the drop-down box for the graph. The graph and the drop-down box appeared, but when trying to use the drop-down, to display the different counties to choose from, none of the counties were there. Once I changed the word "obesity," the drop-down box displayed all of the counties from my dataset. However, this is where I encountered my second challenge. The graph would not populate when setting the drop-down to a specific county. I tried each county and nothing would appear on the graph indicating a data point.
